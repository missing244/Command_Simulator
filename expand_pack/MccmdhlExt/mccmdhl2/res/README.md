# `mccmdhl2` resources
This is the location of default resource files this program uses.

## Files
The files here are:
 - `id_table.json`: The default ID table (aee `autocompleter.IdTable`)
   the program will load. This is untracked in workflow because it is
   generated by `gen_id_table.py` from other data sources like Minecraft's
   official sample data pack.
 - `id_table_manual.json`: The manually written ID table that contains
   IDs that can not be generated. This is merged to `id_table.json`
   using `--merge` or `-m` option of `gen_id_table.py`.
 - `translation.json`: The default translation file. See
   `mccmdhl2/translator.py`.
 - `ease_translation.json`: The translation for easing functions. This
   is passed to `--ease` or `-y` option of `gen_id_table.py` to
   generate explanation of easing functions in an ID table.
